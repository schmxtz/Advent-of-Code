"""Day 11 of Advent of Code 2024.

The goal of parts 1 and 2 are to find the number of stones created after
a certain number of blinks. The stones are either turned from 0 to 1, split
in half if they have an even number of digits, or multiplied by 2024 otherwise.
We can use a recursive function to find the number of stones after a certain
number of blinks.

Because of the recursive nature of the function, we can use a lru_cache to
cache the results of the function calls and improve the performance of the
function. Otherwise the function would be too slow or run out of memory.
