# Advent-of-Code
My solutions for the yearly Advent of Code. I will be using different programming languages to spice things up.

In 2023 I kind of gave up due to uni and work. I also cheated a little due to just using python...

In 2024 I've made up my mind to set myself more challenges and complete the entire challenge with randomly selected programming languages, even if I have no knowledge about them. But learning is fun (except php).

My thoughts about each day:
- Day 1 (Javascript): So far I have not programmed so much in Javascript as in Python or Java. I'm positively suprised about the handling of reading and parsing data. I've always heard bad stuff about it, but so far it is not bad.

- Day 2 (PHP): I have only once programmed in my life with PHP. We had to create a website that used PHP in some shape or form. I was responsible for this part and I don't have any positive memories about it. I like that you can explicitly declare when to pass a variable by reference or to just copy it. But I feel the syntax of accessing variables with *$* and the syntax for foreach is, coming from being used to Python, feels inintuitive. Looking up now the release year of Python (1991) and PHP (1995) I'm suprised to see that Python is older than PHP while it feels much newer.
