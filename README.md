# Advent-of-Code
My solutions for the yearly Advent of Code. I will be using different programming languages to spice things up.

In 2023 I kind of gave up due to uni and work. I also cheated a little due to just using python...

In 2024 I've made up my mind to set myself more challenges and complete the entire challenge with randomly selected programming languages, even if I have no knowledge about them. But learning is fun (except php).
